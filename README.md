
# Simple React + Tailwind Site

This is a small starter project created with Vite, React (TypeScript), and Tailwind CSS. It's intended as a friendly, minimal frontend scaffold you can extend.

Getting started (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\chawa\Test
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser to view the site.

What you'll find
- A small page layout with Home, About and Contact pages
- A dark mode toggle that persists your preference
- Tailwind CSS already configured

Recommended VS Code extensions
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- ESLint
- Prettier

Notes
- This project is frontend-only. Add a backend or API endpoints later and call them from the Contact form if needed.

If you want any feature added (forms that actually send email, CI/CD, deploy config), tell me which and I will scaffold it.

```
